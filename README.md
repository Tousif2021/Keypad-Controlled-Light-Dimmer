# 🔢 Keypad-Controlled Light Dimmer (Assembly) 💡
___ 
### A microcontroller-based light dimmer built using Assembly language and a 4x4 matrix keypad. Users can adjust the brightness percentage dynamically by entering values on the keypad. The system also provides preset brightness levels and a reset function for better usability.
___ 
## ✨ Control your light brightness with simple keypad inputs!
# 🎯 Features
✅ Custom Brightness – Enter a value (e.g., 25D for 25% brightness, 17D for 17%).<br>
✅ Full Brightness (100%) – Press A.<br>
✅ Default Brightness (50%) – Press C.<br>
✅ Reset Input – Press # to clear the input.<br>
✅ Real-time Brightness Control – Adjusts dynamically using PWM.<br>

## 🎛️ Hardware Used
🔹 4x4 Matrix Keypad <br>
🔹 Microcontroller (RISC-V / Any compatible MCU)<br>
🔹 LED / PWM-based Light Control System<br>
___ 
## ⚡ How It Works

1️⃣ Enter a brightness percentage followed by the D key (e.g., 25D → 25% brightness).<br>
2️⃣ Use preset options:<br>
___ 
 Press A for 100% brightness.
 Press C for 50% (default).
___ 
3️⃣ Press # to reset the input and enter a new value.<br>
4️⃣ The system updates the light intensity in real-time using PWM control.<br>
___ 
# 💻 Technologies Used 
##### 🛠️ Assembly Language
##### 📡 Embedded Systems Programming
##### ⚡ PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for Brightness Control
___ 
# 🚀 Installation & Usage 
1️⃣ Flash the Assembly code onto the microcontroller.<br>
2️⃣ Connect the keypad and LED system as per the circuit diagram.<br>
3️⃣ Use the keypad to input desired brightness levels.<br>
4️⃣ Enjoy real-time smooth brightness control! 🎚️💡<br>

# 📌 Future Improvements
 ✨ Adding LCD display feedback for user input.<br>
