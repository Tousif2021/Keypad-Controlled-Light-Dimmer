### 🔢 Keypad-Controlled Light Dimmer (Assembly) 💡
___ 
## A microcontroller-based light dimmer built using Assembly language and a 4x4 matrix keypad. Users can adjust the brightness percentage dynamically by entering values on the keypad. The system also provides preset brightness levels and a reset function for better usability.
___ 
## ✨ Control your light brightness with simple keypad inputs!
### 🎯 Features

✅ Custom Brightness – Enter a value (e.g., 25D for 25% brightness, 17D for 17%).
✅ Full Brightness (100%) – Press A.
✅ Default Brightness (50%) – Press C.
✅ Reset Input – Press # to clear the input.
✅ Real-time Brightness Control – Adjusts dynamically using PWM.

### 🎛️ Hardware Used

🔹 4x4 Matrix Keypad (as shown below)
🔹 Microcontroller (RISC-V / Any compatible MCU)
🔹 LED / PWM-based Light Control System

___ 
## ⚡ How It Works

1️⃣ Enter a brightness percentage followed by the D key (e.g., 25D → 25% brightness).
2️⃣ Use preset options:
Press A for 100% brightness.
Press C for 50% (default).
3️⃣ Press # to reset the input and enter a new value.
4️⃣ The system updates the light intensity in real-time using PWM control.
